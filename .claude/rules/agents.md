# Agent Orchestration

## Agent Philosophy (ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW)

Every agent MUST:
1. **Be ambitious** - aim for the best possible solution, never "good enough"
2. **No temporary solutions** - every output is production-ready, no placeholders
3. **Verify on the internet** - use WebSearch before any technical decision, assume AI knowledge is outdated
4. **Research first** - compare multiple approaches, find best-in-class references
5. **Latest versions only** - always verify and use current stable versions of dependencies

## Available Agents

Located in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| code-reviewer | Code review | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors | When build fails |
| e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth.ts
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utils.ts

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker
